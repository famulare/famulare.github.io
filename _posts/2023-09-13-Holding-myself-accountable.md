title: Holding myself accountable

The screaming in my head is my responsibility to deal with. I will no longer force others to carry it for me, especially those I love. 

From here on out, I will remove myself to grieve, shake, rage, mourn, cry, breath, and heal when I’m overwhelmed.

I accept that it’s okay to ask for help, especially when it feels most wrong to do so. 

The choice is between lashing out and being vulnerable—there is no third option where the screaming just stops because I and everyone around me is perfect. 

I’m a better man in public, so here is my public self holding my private self accountable.

I get a release from my little corners of Hell when I'm no longer alone in them. This has been the reward for lashing out, and tgat reward is why I have continued to do it. 

It's incredibly selfish to bring someone else into Hell to make myself feel better. My mom taught me to do this, but I know it's wrong.

After lashing out and forcing someone else---far too often my wife---to hold me accountable, I feel guilty and ashamed. I try to love-bomb in penance and feel rejected when that doesn't fix it. My dad taught me to do this, but I know it's wrong.
