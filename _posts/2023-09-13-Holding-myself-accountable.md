The screaming in my head is my responsibility to deal with. I will no longer force others to carry it for me, especially those I love. 

From here on out, I will remove myself to grieve, shake, rage, mourn, cry, breath, and heal when I’m overwhelmed.

I accept that it’s okay to ask for help, especially when it feels most wrong to do so. 

The choice is between lashing out and being vulnerable—there is no third option where the screaming just stops because I and everyone around me is perfect. 

I’m a better man in public, so here is my public self holding my private self accountable.
