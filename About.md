My name is Mike Famulare and I've been working as an epidemiological modeler at the [Institute for Disease Modeling](www.idmod.org) for a decade now. In that time, I've been part of a lot of things---some you might've heard of like the [Seattle Flu Study](www.seattleflu.org) and [very stressful days in February 2020](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/health/coronavirus-washington-spread.html) or [This Podcast Will Kill You](https://thispodcastwillkillyou.com/2020/05/04/covid-19-chapter-11-modeling/) ([transcript](http://thispodcastwillkillyou.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/TPWKY-COVID-11-Modeling.pdf)), and [many you probably haven't](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=TPWwr18AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

During this time, I've grown a lot of strong opinions, partially formed and not-so-loosely held, about the practice and philosophy of mathematical modeling in epidemiology. After the last few years, I'm left with a lot of feelings about how to be a _good modeler_ that are bigger and messier than the things I normally do at work can contain. So I need a place to work some stuff out. Hence this blog.
